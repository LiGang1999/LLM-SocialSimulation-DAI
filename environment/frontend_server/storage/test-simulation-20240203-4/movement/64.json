It's a complex issue with many negative consequences for the residents, such as higher rent, lack of affordable housing, and loss of community and cultural identity. I'm studying sociology at Oak Hill College, and I believe it's important to understand the social and economic factors that contribute to gentrification and to explore solutions that can support the existing community while also addressing issues of inequality and poverty."

It's an innovative approach that gives the community more control over the land and can help maintain the character and affordability of the area.

For example, there may be legal and financial barriers to creating and maintaining a community land trust.

Some other potential solutions could include inclusionary zoning policies, community benefit agreements, and tenant protections. Inclusionary zoning requires developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing in their projects. Community benefit agreements are contracts between developers and community organizations that ensure certain benefits are provided to the community. Tenant protections can include rent control and just cause eviction policies to prevent landlords from evicting tenants without justification. I think it's important to explore a combination of these solutions to address the complex issue of gentrification."
