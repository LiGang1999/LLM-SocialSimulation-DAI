They reviewed their calendar or schedule and did not have any specific appointments or events planned for the day. They continued to prioritize staying informed about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant's decision and engaging in conversations about the issue with others who are interested in it. They exchanged information with Maria Lopez and others about organizations and resources working on the issue. They also prepared for their meetings with Maria Lopez at the R.C. Patterson Building, which were scheduled to take place on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, to discuss environmental issues. As they reflected on their activities and plans, they realized that there may be unexpected events or opportunities that could arise during the day, so they decided to stay flexible in their plans. However, they also made a mental note to continue researching and discussing the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant issue with Maria Lopez or others who are knowledgeable about it.",
